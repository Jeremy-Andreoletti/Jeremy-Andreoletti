ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jeremy-Andreoletti, a French biology student at Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure in Paris.

I am interested in studying macroevolution and ecology through the latest mathematical and computational tools. 
I will be starting a PhD thesis in September 2022 with [HÃ©lÃ¨ne Morlon](https://www.phyloeco.bio.ens.psl.eu/index.html) at Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure.
