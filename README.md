ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jeremy-Andreoletti, AI Security Researcher at the [General Purpose AI Policy Lab](https://gpaipolicylab.org), where I build models to forecast AI capabilities and emerging risks.

I recently defended my PhD thesis in computational evolutionary biology at Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure in Paris, supervised by [HÃ©lÃ¨ne Morlon](https://www.phyloeco.bio.ens.psl.eu/index.html).
