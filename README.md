ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jeremy-Andreoletti, a French biology student at Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure in Paris.

I am interested in studying macroevolution and macroecology through the latest mathematical and computational tools. 
I am currently finishing a master's degree in mathematics for life sciences at the University of Paris-Saclay, and starting a year of internships in preparation for a PhD thesis.
